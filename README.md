# RDCiv3
An indie text based civilization game.

## Origin
The RDCiv games began as a hobby project, the first and second released in 2021 and 2022. Unfortunately, the thrid was forgotten after it was begun, until startUpError adopted it to revive the game series.

### How to play
There are currently no playable game builds, but you can find the first two installations of the game on Ninju's itch.io page:
